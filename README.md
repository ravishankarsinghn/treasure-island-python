## Treasure Island `Day 3`

# Instructions

Make your own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. Use conditionals such as `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements to lay out the logic and the story's path in your program. 


### Text Snippets from my example

* 'You\'re at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right"'
* 'You\'ve come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat. Type "swim" to swim across.'
* "You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which colour do you choose?"
* "It\'s a room full of fire. Game Over."
* "You found the treasure! You Win!"
* "You enter a room of beasts. Game Over."
* "You chose a door that doesn\'t exist. Game Over."
* "You get attacked by an angry trout. Game Over."
* "You fell into a hole. Game Over."

# Escaping Characters

If you want to use multiple sets of quotes inside a single string, you might have to "escape" some of them using the backslash `\`. You can see this in my first sentence: 'You\'re at a crossroad...'.
